No hay suficiente oxigeno sin presurizacion', hint: 'Piensa en que le pasa a la presion del aire cuando la altitud aumenta.', answer: 'A 10 km, la presion es ~1/4 del nivel del mar (poco aire para respirar)' },

La presion atmosferica empuja el liquido hacia arriba por el popote!', hint: 'Creas una zona de baja presion dentro del popote.
